Description
-----------

Agricultural use of synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers.

The total quantity Q in principle refers to total agricultural use of
fertilizer. In practice, however, data on non-agricultural use of fertilizer
are scarce and the underlying statistics databases do not always account for
non-agricultural uses. In any case, the assumption here is that Q represents
agricultural uses only, and Q = Q_C + Q_PG, i.e., the total is partitioned
between cropland and permanent grassland.

The rates are calculated by dividing total quantities by areas of cropland
in use (symbol C in dataset land_areas) and permanent grassland, including
unfertilized areas (symbol PG in dataset land_areas).
